## IfElse.m ##

The code defines a number num = 4.

It calculates a = mod(num, 2), which gives the remainder when num is divided by 2.

If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

Since mod(4, 2) = 0, the code goes to the else branch and displays:

## FirstProgramme.m ##

This MATLAB code checks if a number is positive or negative:

It assigns num = -4.

Then it uses an if-else statement:

If num > 0, it displays "The value is positive!".

Otherwise, it displays "The value is negative!".

## WhileLoop.m ##

This MATLAB code uses a while loop to display numbers from 1 to 5:

It starts with i = 1.

While i is less than 6, it:

Displays the value of i.

Increments i by 1.
